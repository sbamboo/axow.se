<br>

**Datapack Changes**
- Updated all datapacks to the new version.

**Resourcepack Changes**<br>
Since *1.21.6* Mojang updated validation for resourcepack files, so the resource pack has been fixed accordingly.<br>

## A note to the previous article
The last server update changed a lot about how custom items work. For more information about crafting recipes and changes, read the **"1.21.5 Server Update"** article.

## Whats next?

Happy summer everyone!
