## ServerSide
**Version Change**
- I haven't had time to update my clients for 1.21.3, until then you may use any other 1.21.3 client or add [ViaFabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabric) or [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) to your modpacks.<br>
<br>

**Mod Changes**
- Replaced `AntiEntityGrief` with `MobExplosionGriefingGamerule`.<br>
- Skipped `DisconnectPacketFix` since it is not updated.<br>
- Skipped `Horsebuff` since it is not updated.<br>
- Skipped `LeashMod` since it is not updated.<br>
- Also skipped some other maintenance mods for the same reason.<br>
- Replaced `Fsit` with `!Sit` mod, since it was broken, this sadly means no sitting on players for now :(<br>
<br>

**Datapack / Resourcepack Changes**
- Forked MoreArmorTrims to work with 1.21.3, sadly no emmissives for now...<br>
  Also armorsets using the custom trims might now render correctly until re-trimmed, will decide on a solution in the future resourcepack re-make.
