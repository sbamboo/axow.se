**After a week of work and a happy easter the server is finally updated! üê£**
<br><br>

## ServerSide
**Version Change**
Updated the server to the Spring to Life drop *(1.21.5)*, adding cold and warm variants to animals and new decorative bushes.<br>
And not to forget the cactus flower!ü™∑
<br>

**Mod Changes**
- Replaced `AntiEntityGrief` with `MobExplosionGamerule` since the former has not updated.<br>
- Testing an unfinished version of `BluemapMarkerManager` since it has not updated.<br>
- Skipped the `HorseBuff` mod since I need time to test if crashes has been fixed.<br>
- Skipped `Noisium` since it is not updated.<br>
<br>

**Datapack Changes**
- Updated all vanilla-tweaks datapacks to 1.21.5.
- `MoreArmorTrims` has been removed for now, I might make another custom fork if I have time but we will see. For now if you have issues with previously trimmed armor not rendering contact me.
- Made a custom fork of `Pengu's Head Equip` so the curse-of-binding check should now work again. *(If not please contact me)*
- Added `painting-picker` from vanilla-tweaks allowing you to get items for specific paintings using a stonecutter. Recommended to be used with their `Unique Painting Items` resourcepack.
<br>

**Resourcepack Issues**
Completely remade the server resourcepack, phew!<br>
Since Mojang added the ability of CIT in vanilla the server's custom items no longer require Optifine or CIT-Resewn!<br>
This does mean the way custom items are made has also changed, and what items can be made by players.<br>
- Flower crowns can now be crafted by placing three of the flower items next to eachother in the crafting grid.
  - For `pink_daisy` use `pink petals`.
  - For `buttercup` use `raw gold`
- Flower crowned armor helmets are now craftable by adding your helmet and the flower-item to the grafting grid. **(Please note this can't be undone)**
I have manually migrated the items I found on the server, if you have un-migrated legacy custom items please contact me.<br> **DO NOT MOVE THEM!** I will need the coordinates of where they where placed `2025-04-21` to verify them.<br> *(If you do not know the cordinates or have questions just contact me anyways)*
<br>

## Whats next?
- Fixing any missing features.
- Making 1.21.4 clients.
- 1.21.4 Have changed how items work in resourcepacks so I am planning on re-making the server resourcepack from the ground up.
- Also some more stability testing and work!
- Might add the [Vivecraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/vivecraft) mod.
