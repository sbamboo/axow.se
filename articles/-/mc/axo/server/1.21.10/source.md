## ServerSide
**Version Change**
Updated the server to the The Copper Age drop *(1.21.9)* and the *1.21.10* patch update, adding shelves and copper golemns!<br>
*(The previous 1.21.9 version is intercompatible with the 1.21.10 hotfix update)*
<br><br>

**Mod Changes**
- Updated mods to the new version<br>
- Since `bluemap-marker-manager` had not updated, markers have been migrated to bluemaps built-in config format.
- Switched `mob-explosion-griefing` to `noexplosiongrief`, if mobs that previously did not destroy blocks now do, please contact me!
- Updated `fsit` which seems to work abit better now, for example unmounting the players ontop of you seems to work, more testing is needed tho.
<br>

**Datapack/Resourcepack Changes**
- In *1.21.9* all datapacks and resourcepacks had their format changed slightly, all packs have been updated accordingly.
- Added crafting and textures for *flower-crowning* the new copper helmets.
- **Note! Currently there are some known issues with the rendering of emojis in the serverside resourcepack**
<br><br>

## Custom crafting and items
The older [1.21.5 Server Update](https://axow.se/articles#mc/axo/server/1.21.5) article contained alot of information about how custom items work and are crafted.

## Whats next?
- Stability testing!
- Checking if anything was broken by the update.


## And of course:
Soon happy halloween everyone! ðŸŽƒ
