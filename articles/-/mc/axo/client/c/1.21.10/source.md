## Note!
This is a smaller pre-release, usually I release three clients *lite*, *standard* and *mooare* and each in two variants *E (essentials mod)* and *C (e4mc mod)*.<br>
However since *e4mc* have not yet updated and I have had less time then usual for the clients I am choosing to release only two pre-release clients, *Standard E* and *Mooare E*.<br>
The plan is ofcourse to release the other clients as more things have updated, *or in worst case on the next update cycle*.
<br>

## Standard Community Client
Contains additional QoL features compared to the *Lite* clients.

## A note regarding the NoChatReports mod
The previous article [1.21.7 Client Release](https://axow.se/articles/#mc/axo/client/c/1.21.7) had notes about the [NoChatReports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) mod, what it is, my thoughts about it in my clients, and how to disable it if you want to.
