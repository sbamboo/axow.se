                <h2>Join The Server</h2>
                <p>For those who have been whitelisted, the server is accessable using the ip in my discord under the <span class="discord-channel">#server-info</span> channel.</p>
                <p>In the same channel you can also find the current server version and other information.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Clients?</h2>
                <p>The server is avaliable to join on Vanilla Java/Bedrock Edition, or vanilla compatible clients like <a class="thirdparty-client-link" href="https://optifine.net/downloads">Optifine</a>.</p>
                <p>However the server has certain custom Vanilla+ features, like <a class="mod-link" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat">Voice Chat</a>. Thus I recommend using a modpack/client that includes these features, if you don't know what to download I host my own modpacks/clients at <a class="firstparty-client-link" href="https://sbamboo.github.io/mcc-web">MinecraftCustomClient/Downloads</a>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Resourcepacks?</h2>
                <p>The server does apply a custom resourcepack when you join to include ex. custom-item-textures. Information for the resourcepack can be found at <a class="rsp-info" href="https://sbamboo.github.io/websa?id=lt">sbamboo.github.io/websa?id=lt</a></p>
                <p>If you are having issues with the resourcepack, you can disable it for the server and download it yourself from <a class="rsp-down" href="https://github.com/sbamboo/serverpacks/tree/main/The%20Axolot%2077">https://github.com/sbamboo/serverpacks</a>.</p>

                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>In general the rules can be summarized as to not ruin the experience for anyone else. Use common sense!</p>
                <b class="topmar">Specifics</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>No cheating, or doings that in otherways grant an unfair advantage.</li>
                    <li>Griefing is never allowed, nor is destruction of other peoples things in general, if someone has built things where they aren't suppose to and won't remove it, contact an admin.<br><i class="grayed-slightly">(In other words building on/inside someone else's place without permission counts as griefing)</i></li>
                    <li>Duping is not allowed! The only exception for this is redstone flying-machine TNT dupers since they only dupe the TNT entity and not the block or item, carpet/sand/rail dupers are thus not allowed.</li>
                    <li>Offensive actions/messages towards someone is never allowed. This includes chat-messages, custom-sounds, builds and ingame-texts like signs. This should be a safe community for anyone!</li>
                    <li>The server in general has no building rules, however each base/town/city/region can define their own rules. Note, the server's general rules always apply!</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Is X mod allowed?</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using a minimap? Disable cave-mode so you only see the world from the top.</li>
                    <li>Bot-automations like Baritone might be allowed, but generally not, ask server-owner first.</li>
                    <li>Freecam is allowed, but you may not use it as a cheat, ex. look under the world.</li>
                    <li>Any mods/resourcepacks that provide unfair advantages or cheats are not allowed. For example Xray packs.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="extra-padding">
                <h2>Getting invited?</h2>
                <p>The server is invite-only and only for friends.</p>
                <p class="QAq">Do you know me and want to get in? Or are you already invited and wants to invite your friend?</p>
                <p class="QAa">Please contact me :D</p>
                <i>In certain cases non-friends may be invitied, if I know who they are, but this is a case-by-case thing</i>
