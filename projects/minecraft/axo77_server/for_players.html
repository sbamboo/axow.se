                <h2>Join The Server</h2>
                <p>For those who have been whitelisted, the server is accessable using the ip in my discord under the <p class="discord-channel">#server-info</p> channel.</p><br>
                <p>In the same channel you can also find the current server version and other information.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Clients?</h2>
                <p>The server is avaliable to join on Vanilla Java/Bedrock Edition, or vanilla compatible clients like <a class="thirdparty-client-link" href="https://optifine.net/downloads">Optifine</a>.</p><br>
                <p>However the server has certain custom Vanilla+ features, like <a class="mod-link" href="https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat-music">Voice Chat</a>. Thus I recommend using a modpack/client that includes these features, if you don't know what to download I host my own modpacks/clients at <a class="firstparty-client-link" href="https://sbamboo.github.io/mcc-web">MinecraftCustomClient/Downloads</a>.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Resourcepacks?</h2>
                <p>The server does apply a custom resourcepack when you join to include ex. custom-item-textures. Information for the resourcepack can be found at <a class="rsp-info" href="https://sbamboo.github.io/websa?id=lt">sbamboo.github.io/websa?id=lt</a></p><br><br>
                <p>If you are having issues with the resourcepack, you can disable it for the server and download it yourself from <a class="rsp-down" href="https://github.com/sbamboo/serverpacks/tree/main/The%20Axolot%2077">https://github.com/sbamboo/serverpacks</a>.</p>
